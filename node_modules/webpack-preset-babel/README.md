Adds Babel as loader to all `.js` and `.jsx` files. Does not include any [presets](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/). They're all in [separate packages](#presets).

**Requires [webpack-preset](https://github.com/webpack-preset/webpack-preset)**

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save webpack-preset webpack-preset-babel
```

## Presets

Since we don't include any presets, this won't do much by itself. Install whatever preset package you'd like to get access to all those shiny Babel features.
